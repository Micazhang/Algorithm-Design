# Algorithm-Design
Use the edit distance (class Sequences.java) implementation provided in the source code.
a. Generate 1,000 pairs of random words of lengths 10, 20, 50 and 100.
b. Compute the edit distance for all words and find the average CPU time for each pair.
c. Compare the CPU times obtained for each word length with the running times of the edit distance algorithm.
